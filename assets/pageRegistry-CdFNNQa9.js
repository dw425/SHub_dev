How do you rate limit abusive clients? How do you transform legacy protocols to modern APIs?

Early convolutional layers capture universal low-level features such as edges, textures, and color gradients that transfer remarkably well across domains. Middle layers encode more complex patterns like shapes and object parts, while the final layers learn highly task-specific features that typically require fine-tuning.

Advanced techniques like CutOut, MixUp, and CutMix have revolutionized augmentation by forcing models to learn more robust representations—CutOut masks random patches, MixUp blends images and labels together, and CutMix combines regions from different images.

Creating threads is expensive—each requires memory allocation, OS resources, and context switching overhead. A thread pool pre-creates a fixed number of worker threads that wait for tasks. When tasks arrive, available workers execute them. When done, workers return to the pool rather than terminating. This amortizes creation cost across many tasks and prevents resource exhaustion from unbounded thread creation. Most web servers, application servers, and async frameworks use thread pools internally. Key decisions include pool size (often CPU cores for compute-bound, larger for I/O-bound), queue strategy (bounded vs unbounded), and rejection policy (what happens when the pool is saturated)."]},{heading:"Async/Await Pattern",paragraphs:["Non-blocking operations with synchronous-style code",`Async/await revolutionized how we write concurrent code by making asynchronous operations look synchronous. Traditional callbacks led to "callback hell"—deeply nested code that's hard to read and debug. Promises improved this with chaining, but async/await goes further. When you await an async operation, the runtime suspends the current function, frees the thread to do other work, and resumes when the result is ready. The code reads top-to-bottom like synchronous code, but executes non-blocking. Under the hood, compilers transform async functions into state machines. This pattern dominates modern JavaScript, Python, C#, Rust, and Kotlin.
