Nation-states pursue geopolitical advantage through espionage and sabotage. Cybercriminals seek financial gain through ransomware, fraud, and data theft.

Phishing remains the most common initial access technique, succeeding through human manipulation rather than technical exploits. Ransomware has evolved from simple encryption to multi-extortion schemes threatening data leaks. Supply chain attacks compromise trusted software to reach thousands of downstream targets. Zero-day exploits target unknown vulnerabilities before patches exist. Cloud misconfigurations expose data through improper access controls. Understanding these vectors is essential for building layered defenses.',

Understanding this framework helps defenders identify where to detect and disrupt attacks. Early-stage detection (reconnaissance, weaponization) is ideal but difficult. Most organizations detect attacks during delivery or exploitation. The key insight: breaking the chain at any point stops the attack. Defense-in-depth ensures multiple opportunities to detect and respond before adversaries achieve their goals.',
